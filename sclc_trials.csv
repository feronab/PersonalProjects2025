NCT04696575,Lamivudine in Combination With Chemoimmunotherapy for the Treatment of Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer,RECRUITING,"This phase II trial studies the effect of lamivudine in combination with standard of care chemoimmunotherapy in treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Even though small cell lung cancer is initially highly responsive to first-line chemotherapy treatment, treatment resistance inevitably emerges; treatment resistance is when tumor cells stop responding to a drug treatment that they had previously responded to. Lamivudine is an oral antiviral a drug that may be able to reduce the ability of tumors to develop drug resistance. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. LB-100 has been shown to make anticancer drugs (chemotherapy) work better at killing cancer. LB-100 blocks a protein on the surface of cells called PP2A. Blocking this protein makes the tumor cells that express PP2A divide. This allows standard chemotherapy drugs such as carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab work better at killing the tumor cells since these drugs work best at destroying cells that are dividing.

Lung cancer is classified into different types, among which small cell lung cancer (SCLC), accounting for 13%-20% of all lung cancer cases \[Pezzuto et al., 2019; Torres-Durán et al., 2021\], is an aggressive form of neuroendocrine malignancy characterized by rapid growth, tendency to disseminate early and high relapse rates \[El Sayed and Blais, 2021\].

There are persistently limited treatment options for SCLC \[DiBonaventura et al., 2019; El Sayed and Blais, 2021\], and the current clinical approach to SCLC treatment is chosen irrespective of biological subtype \[Rudin et al., 2021; Keogh et al., 2022\]. First-line treatments for ES-SCLC have been platinum-based chemotherapy combinations for decades, without significant differences in Overall Survival (OS) between cisplatin and carboplatin, valuing flexibility in the choice of platinum agent in treatment decision making for individual patients \[Dingemans et al., 2021\]. However, despite the high initial response rate, the prognosis remains poor \[Zhang et al., 2021; Johal et al., 2021\].

In recent years, immunotherapy has dramatically modified cancer treatment across several malignancies and has been an active area of investigation in SCLC \[Calles et al., 2019; Dingemans et al., 2021\]. Treatments that combine chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as durvalumab and atezolizumab, can increase immune responses to tumor cells, resulting in improved efficacy in ES-SCLC compared to chemotherapy alone \[Esposito et al., 2020; Konala et al., 2020; Hiddinga et al., 2021; Lim and Kang, 2021\]. These treatment regimens have been approved in many countries \[Wang et al., 2022\] and are now the standard of care in the ES-SCLC first-line setting, according to the ESMO \[Dingemans et al., 2021\] and the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology \[Ganti et al., 2022\].

Durvalumab is a fully human, immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks the interaction of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) with PD-1 and CD80 \[IMFINZI® (durvalumab) Summary of Product Characteristics\]. The phase III CASPIAN study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03043872) showed that the addition of durvalumab to a combination regimen of etoposide with either cisplatin or carboplatin significantly improved OS compared with etoposide and platinum alone, with a manageable tolerability profile \[Paz-Ares et al., 2019; Goldman et al., 2021; Paz-Ares et al., 2022\].

Following the CASPIAN study, an Early Access Programme (EAP) to provide pre-approval access to durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide for ES-SCLC patients eligible to receive first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (D419QR00007 EAP, hereafter called 'CASPIAN EAP') was activated in Italy in March 2020, including 125 subjects across 39 oncology centers.

Clinical trials have demonstrated significant efficacy and a favorable safety profile of durvalumab combined with chemotherapy in ES-SCLC \[Paz-Ares et al., 2022\]. On the other hand, it is estimated that stringent eligibility criteria may exclude up to 70% of patients with lung cancer from ICI clinical trials \[von Itzstein et al., 2020\]. Understanding the efficacy and safety of ICIs in a more heterogeneous patient population than in randomized controlled trials is critical to realizing the full potential of these therapies. To fill the gap between strictly controlled clinical trial populations and actual lung cancer patients managed in clinical practice, observational studies from real-world settings are emerging \[von Itzstein et al., 2020\]. Although real-world studies are unable to achieve the high internal validity of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), accurately performed analyses of real-world data can provide valuable complementary results \[Nazha et al., 2021\].

In conclusion, considering that ES-SCLC are often elderly patients with multiple comorbidities \[Schulkes et al., 2016\] for whom the treatment decision-making is challenging \[DiBonaventura et al., 2019\], the ARAL observational study will contribute to filling the information gap by collecting real-world data from the CASPIAN EAP to better describe durvalumab treatment outcomes and treatment patterns among patients diagnosed with ES-SCLC in Italy.",NO,Small Cell Lung Carcinoma,DRUG: Durvalumab,"Overall survival, OS rate at 12 and 18 months after index date (defined as Day 1 of Cycle 1 - C1 D1 of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy), 12 and 18 months after index date|Overall survival, Median OS, From index date to death or date of enrollment in the study (up to 5 years)|Overall Survival, Mean OS, From index date to death or date of enrollment in the study (up to 5 years)","Overall Survival, OS rate at 24 months after index date (defined as platinum-etoposide chemotherapy C1 D1)., 24 months after index date|Progression Free Survival, PFS rate at 12, 18 and 24 months after index date., 12, 18, 24 months after index date|Progression free survival, Median PFS, From index date to death or progression or date of enrollment in the study (up to 5 years)|Time to discontinuation, Median TTD, From index date to last dose of treatment with durvalumab or death or date of enrollment in the study (up to 5 years)|Time to First Subsequent Therapy or Death, Median TFST, From index date to start of other cancer treatment or death or date of enrollment in the study (up to 5 years)|Pattern of relapse, Patterns of relapse after durvalumab treatment (e.g., thoracic/extra-thoracic/central nervous system - CNS relapse)., From index date to date to progression or death or date of enrollment in the study (up to 5 years)|Duration of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy, Duration of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy prior to durvalumab maintainance initiation, From index date until durvalumab maintenance initiation or death or discontinuation of treatment (up to 5 years)|durvalumab treatment duration, durvalumab treatment duration, From initiation of durvalumab until death or date of enrollment in the study (up to 5 years)|number of durvalumab administrations, number of durvalumab administrations, From initiation of durvalumab until death or date of enrollment in the study (up to 5 years)|reason for durvalumab dosage adjustment, reason for durvalumab dosage adjustment, From initiation of durvalumab until death or date of enrollment in the study (up to 5 years)|reason for temporary interruption or permanent discontinuation, reason for temporary interruption or permanent discontinuation of durvalumab, (e.g., safety event), From initiation of durvalumab until death or date of enrollment in the study (up to 5 years)|Concomitant tratments, Details of chemotherapy (platinum-etoposide) combined with durvalumab and other concomitant treatments., From initiation of durvalumab until death or date of enrollment in the study (up to 5 years)|Subsequent anticancer treatments, Details of subsequent anticancer treatments; treatment sequences over time for ES-SCLC., From discontinuation of durvalumab until death or date of enrollment in the study (up to 5 years)|Adverse Event of Special interest (AESI)verbatim; severity; seriousness; causality; action taken with respect to durvalumab treatment; outcome., To evaluate safety and tolerability profile of durvalumab + EP treatment, adverse events of special interests were assessed.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. PARPs are proteins that help repair damage to DNA, the genetic material that serves as the body's instruction book. Changes (mutations) in DNA can cause tumor cells to grow quickly and out of control, but PARP inhibitors like talazoparib may keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they stop growing.

NCT04402788,"Testing the Addition of Radiation Therapy to the Usual Immune Therapy Treatment (Atezolizumab) for Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer, The RAPTOR Trial",RECRUITING,"This phase II/III trial compares the effect of adding radiation therapy to the usual maintenance therapy with atezolizumab versus atezolizumab alone in patients who have already received atezolizumab plus chemotherapy for the treatment of small cell lung cancer that has spread outside of the lung or to other parts of the body (extensive stage). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving radiation therapy in addition to atezolizumab may extend the time without extensive small cell lung cancer growing or spreading compared to atezolizumab alone.",NO,Extensive Stage Lung Small Cell Carcinoma,DRUG: Atezolizumab|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy,"Progression-free survival (PFS) (Phase II), Will compare the distributions of PFS between treatment arms using a one-sided stratified log-rank test in all randomized eligible patients. The rates at various timepoints (e.g., every 6 months after randomization) and medians of PFS for each arm will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The associated 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated using Greenwood's formula and based on a log-log transformation applied on the survival function. Results from an unstratified analysis will also be provided., From randomization to any documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 6 years|Overall survival (OS) (Phase III), Will compare arm I to arm 2 based on OS using a stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratios will be estimated using a stratified Cox regression model. Event rates over time will be estimated within each treatment group using the Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization to the date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 6 years","Incidence of adverse events, For each patient, the maximum severity reported for both immune mediated and non-immune mediated adverse events will be used in the summaries. Adverse events will be summarized regardless of relationship to protocol treatment as assessed by the investigator. All adverse events, adverse events leading to withdrawal, interruption or modification of protocol treatment, grade \>= 3 adverse events, and serious adverse events will be summarized. Deaths and cause of death will be summarized. The rate of treatment-related adverse events using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version \[v.\]5.0) will be reported with the frequency and severity (e.g., type, grade, and attribution) by arm, the analysis will be performed at the time of both phase II and phase III (if applicable) primary endpoint analyses. All adverse events will be classified as either immune or non-immune mediated., Up to 6 years|PFS (Phase III), Assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Will compare the distributions of PFS between treatment arms using a one-sided stratified log-rank test in all randomized eligible patients at 0.025 level. The rates at various timepoints (e.g., every 6 months after randomization) and medians of PFS for each arm will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The associated 95% CI will be calculated using Greenwood's formula and based on a log-log transformation applied on the survival function. If one stratum has less than 10 events, the stratification factor which contains the level with the smallest number of patients will be removed from the stratified analyses., Up to 6 years|PFS in patients with 1-3 distinct visible tumors and > 3 distinct visible tumors, Will be similarly summarized and compared between experimental and control. The interaction between the treatment groups and tumor number groups will also be explored in Cox regression model., Up to 6 years|OS in patients with 1-3 distinct visible tumors and > 3 distinct visible tumors, Will be similarly summarized and compared between experimental and control. The interaction between the treatment groups and tumor number groups will also be explored in Cox regression model., Up to 6 years|PFS in patients receiving consolidation radiotherapy to all visible disease and patients who do not receive consolidation radiotherapy to all visible disease, Up to 6 years|OS in patients receiving consolidation radiotherapy to all visible disease and patients who do not receive consolidation radiotherapy to all visible disease, Up to 6 years","Tumor burden, Tumor burden determined by central radiographic assessment, using both tumor number and tumor volume will be associated with PFS and OS benefit. The PFS and OS will be similarly summarized and compared between experimental and control in the following subgroups: 1) high or low tumor burden, using \>= 4, 5, or 6 metastases as a cutoff; 2) high or low tumor burden, using the median of centrally reviewed radiographic tumor volume as a cutoff., Up to 6 years",National Cancer Institute (NCI),NRG Oncology,PHASE2|PHASE3,138,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2021-01-07,2027-04-30,2027-04-30,2020-05-27,,2025-08-05,"University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Center, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|Katmai Oncology Group, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Cancer Center at Saint Joseph's, Phoenix, Arizona, 85004, United States|Mayo Clinic Hospital in Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona, 85054, United States|Mayo Clinic in Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259, United States|Banner University Medical Center -

NCT05683977,A French Real-life Study: EvaluatioN of durvALumab Utilization and Effectiveness for First Line Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), characterized by rapid proliferation, high growth fraction and early development of metastases, is the most aggressive form of lung cancer. In 2021, an estimated 2.3 million people around the world are diagnosed with lung cancer. In France, in 2018, with 46 363 new cases and 33 117 deaths, lung cancer represented the second most common cancer and the first cause of death from cancer. Among those, SCLC represented 10,8% of all new lung diagnosis, and about two thirds presented at the extensive stage (ES-SCLC).

Since last three decades, standard treatment in ES-SCLC is based on combination chemotherapy with a platinum agent and etoposide in first-line with or without concurrent radiation therapy. Then, the second-line of treatment is topotecan, with few results in terms of response rates and survival rate. However, the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, having an important role in immune regulation became an alternative method in the management and care of disease. Indeed, recent studies have shown an overall survival (OS) benefit for patients with ES-SCLC treated in first line with a combination of platinum-etoposide and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Atezolizumab (Tecentriq®, Roche) and durvalumab (Imfinzi®, AstraZeneca), two anti-Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies, delivered positive phase III results, respectively through the Impower-133 and CASPIAN studies, and were granted European market authorisations.

Durvalumab is approved for use in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with ES-SCLC. On March 10, 2020 French health authorities allowed durvalumab utilization in this setting through a national ""early access program"" (Autorisation Temporaire d'Utilisation ""de cohorte"" - ATUc), thus preceding the European market authorization (August 28, 2020). Since 2020 October 1st, durvalumab is used as a post ATU treatment. Since 2020, French AURA treatment guidelines for SCLC have referenced durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment option for patients with ES-SCLC.

Whereas the safety and efficacy of the durvalumab have been evaluated in a clinical trial, data are required to further evaluate the use of durvalumab in real-life condition and in less selected population than in clinical trials.",NO,Small Cell Lung Carcinoma,DRUG: durvalumab,"The time to first line treatment discontinuation (TTD)., For patients who start durvalumab at a later cycle than first cycle PE, the index date will be the first infusion of PE.

If the treatment is stopped during the first phase of 4 to 6 cycles (induction) with a new re- start of durvalumab and PE, the treatment will be considered as temporary stop. If the treatment is stopped during the durvalumab maintenance with a re-start of durvalumab in monotherapy, the treatment will be also considered as temporary stop.

Durvalumab will be considered definitely discontinued when the maintenance phase with durvalumab in monotherapy is stopped and results in a new administration of PE (+/-durvalumab) (subsequent treatment line).

For patients still receiving durvalumab at the end of follow-up or when they are lost to follow-up, TTD will be right-censored at the last recorded day of ongoing durvalumab treatment., TTD is defined as the time from the index date to the date of last durvalumab infusion (+3 weeks during induction period and +4 weeks during maintenance period) or date of death (up to 36 months)).","Real-world Overall Survival (rwOS), rwOS is defined as the time from index date (date of first infusion of durvalumab and/ or platinum-etoposide) to date of death due to any cause. rwOS will be censored on the last date patient is known to be alive.

NCT07057791,Phase II Study of Platinum/Etoposide Plus Ivonescimab for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Eligible untreated participants with Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC) who are ≥ 18 years of age will be randomized to receive ivonescimab 10 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) or ivonescimab 20 mg/kg in combination with carboplatin and etoposide.

Ivonescimab is a type of drug called a bispecific antibody. Antibodies are proteins that specifically recognize and bind to other types of proteins called antigens. Antibodies and antigens can work together to help the immune system fight cancer cells. Bispecific antibody, meaning it targets two different molecules at the same time.

Ivonescimab is a new drug that may help the immune system attack cancer cells and may also block certain pathways that cancer uses to grow and spread. This dual action of ivonescimab aims to help the immune system to fight the cancer and also disrupt tumor growth by blocking blood vessel formation that tumors use to grow.

Participants will receive induction with 4 cycles of ivonescimab (dose determined by randomization) with standard of care carboplatin and etoposide followed by maintenance therapy with ivonescimab at the same dose received during induction. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or participant withdrawal.

The purpose of this study is to determine what dose of ivonescimab works best in combination with carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy in ES-SCLC. We will also examine the side effects, good and bad, associated with ivonescimab.",NO,Extensive Stage Lung Small Cell Cancer,DRUG: Ivonescimab 10 mg/kg|DRUG: Ivonescimab 20 mg/kg,"Optimal Dose of Ivonescimab in Combination with Carboplatin and Etoposide - Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best response on treatment based on RECIST v1.1 criteria at each dose level., 18 months|Optimal Dose of Ivonescimab in Combination with Carboplatin and Etoposide - Grade 3-5 Treatment-Related Toxicity Rate, All grade 3-5 adverse events (AE) with treatment attribution of possibly, probably or definite based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE V5.0) that are not resolved in accordance with treatment guidelines will be counted.

However, although the initial treatment has a high effective rate, most patients relapse or progress within 1 year, and the effect of re-treatment is poor and the prognosis is poor. The effective rate of SCLC second-line treatment is only 10-25%, and the median survival time is less than 6 months. After the third and fourth lines, there are almost no recognized treatment options. Therefore, improving the second-line treatment of SCLC has always been a difficult clinical problem, and new drugs are urgently needed to be explored. In small cell lung cancer, based on phase II clinical trials, paclitaxel is currently recommended by NCCN guidelines for subsequent systemic therapy in patients who relapse 6 months or less after initial therapy.

NCT06406673,A Phase II Clinical Study of Cadonilimab in Treatment-naïve or Relapsed Extensive Small Cell Lung Cancer,RECRUITING,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% of lung cancer cases and is an aggressive cancer characterized by rapid growth, early metastasis, and a poor prognosis. Approximately 75% of SCLC patients present with extensive-stage disease at the time of diagnosis, which is classically defined as a disease that cannot be encompassed by a single radiation field. Before the era of immunotherapy, the standard first-line therapy for ES-SCLC was platinum-based chemotherapy with etoposide; Once complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) was achieved after chemotherapy, consolidative thoracic radiation was recommended. Despite this standard treatment, the median overall survival (OS) of ES-SCLC is about 8-11 months, which has not changed for about 40 years. Combining concurrent radiotherapy of the thorax and immunochemotherapy may have a synergistic effect.

Besides, for patients with recurrent SCLC, topotecan remains the only approved second-line treatment, and the outcomes are poor. With the most recent approval of EP plus a programmed death ligand 1(PD-L1) inhibitor, there are now more therapeutic options for managing ES-SCLC.The best second-line therapy after combination of chemo-immunotherapy is not well defined, as many second-line therapies were studied only after use of EP. However, second-line treatment options for patients with relapsed ES-SCLC are limited and include reintroduction of EP (with or without an immunotherapy), lurbinectedin, and topotecan.

Therefore, we designed this trial to explore the efficacy and safety of cadonilimab as second-line therapy for ES-SCLC. We present a safety profile and a final analysis of ORR.

In this single-center phase 2 trial, Cohort_1 patients with no history of previous systemic treatment for ES-SCLC received cadonilimab with EC/EP for two cycles (induction phase), then, those who did not progress received concurrent palliative RT and two cycles of cadonilimab with EC/EP (combination phase). Afterward they received cadonilimab every 3 weeks for a maximum of 2 years after study enrolment (maintenance phase). Cohort_2 patients with recurrent SCLC and after at most one systemic treatment received cadonilimab plus vorolanib, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

NCT05745350,"First Line Pembrolizumab, Plinabulin Plus Etoposide and Platinum (EP) for ES-SCLC",RECRUITING,"Monoclonal antibodies against programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 have shown efficacy in patients with ES-SCLC in the monotherapy and combination therapy settings. Up to now, Atezolizumab and Durvalumab has been approved for first line treatment for ES-SCLC in China combined with EP or EC. Besides, KEYNOTE-604 study revealed that adding pembrolizumab to standard first-line EP significantly improves PFS in patients with ES-SCLC and is associated with durable responses in a subset of patients. 12-m PFS rate were 13.6% with pembrolizumab plus EP and 3.1% with placebo plus EP. The statistical threshold for declaring significant prolongation of OS was narrowly missed. Considering sicker pts was enrolled and the interim analysis was quite often, even though the investigators narrowly missed the OS endpoint, longer numerical OS data was observed. The latest version of NCCN SCLC guidelines still recommended pembrolizumab as an option for ES-SCLC patients.

Plinabulin received breakthrough designation from both US and China FDA for CIN (Chemotherapy Induced Neutropenia) prevention indication. As a ""pipeline in a drug,"" plinabulin is being broadly studied in combination with various immuno-oncology agents that could boost the effects of the PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and re-sensitize PD-1/PD-L1 antibody resistant patients. In a poster released at 2021 ASCO conference, a phase I trial of Plinabulin in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer: Big Ten Center Research Consortium (BTCRC-LUN17-127) study. Plinabulin in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab was safe and well tolerated with promising efficacy signal of 46% ORR.

From above, Pembrolizumab, Plinabulin plus Etoposide and Platinum as First-Line Therapy for ES-SCLC should be a promising combination therapy, as the investigators expect increased efficacy and reduced toxicity with the addition of Plinabulin.

Lutathera is an investigational radioactive agent that targets tumor cells that express SSRT. Nivolumab is an investigational agent that targets and inhibits a pathway that prevents your immune system from effectively fighting your cancer. The combination of these 2 study drugs is investigational. The term ""Investigational"" in this context means that the drugs have not been approved for clinical use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Giving Lutathera and nivolumab together may increase the effectiveness of this therapy. We first need to find out the highest dose of Lutathera that can be given safely together with nivolumab. This study will be the first study to test giving Lutathera together with nivolumab. Once we have found the highest dose of Lutathera that can be given with nivolumab, we will treat more patients with this combination to determine how effective it is.

The purposes of this study are:

To find the highest doses of Lutathera that can be given with nivolumab without causing severe side effects.

To find out the side effects seen by giving Lutathera at different dose levels with nivolumab.

Emerging evidence supports the synergistic interactions between immunotherapy and radiation therapy.

Approximately 140 patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive treatment with either roniciclib or placebo in combination with chemotherapy.

Roniciclib is an oral (i.e. taken by mouth) protein kinase inhibitor. A kinase inhibitor targets certain key proteins that are essential for the survival of the cancer cell. The growth of the tumor may be decreased by preventing these specific proteins from functioning. By specifically targeting these proteins, roniciclib in combination with chemotherapy may stop cancer growth.

The primary endpoint (the most meaningful result to be tracked) of this study is based on the progression free survival, i.e. the time the disease is not worsening. The aim is to show that the therapy with roniciclib in combination with chemotherapy prolongs the time the disease is not worsening in this patient population compared to patients receiving placebo in combination with chemotherapy.",NO,Small Cell Lung Carcinoma,DRUG: Roniciclib (BAY1000394)|DRUG: Placebo,"Progression free survival (PFS), Up to 17 months","Overall survival (OS), Up to 17 months|Time to progression (TTP), Up to 17 months|Overall response rate (ORR), Up to 17 months",,Bayer,,PHASE2,142,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2014-07-30,2015-12-31,2016-05-25,2014-06-11,,2018-06-25,"Boca Raton, Florida, 33486, United States|Port Saint Lucie, Florida, 34952, United States|Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110-1093, United States|Hershey, Pennsylvania, 17033, United States|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15232, United States|Charleston, South Carolina, 29425, United States|Nashville, Tennessee, 37232, United States|Bruxelles - Brussel, 1200, Belgium|Liege, 4000, Belgium|Brest, 29285, France|Lille Cedex, 59020, France|Marseille Cedex 20, 13915, France|Paris, 75020, France|Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, 69126, Germany|Oldenburg, Niedersachsen, 26121, Germany|Essen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, 45147, Germany|Grosshansdorf, 22927, Germany|Budapest, 1121, Hungary|Matrahaza, 3233, Hungary|Torokbalint, 2045, Hungary|Genova, Liguria, 16132, Italy|Monza-Brianza, Lombardia, 20900, Italy|Sondrio, Lombardia, 23035, Italy|Torino, Piemonte, 10043, Italy|Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0011, Japan|Bunkyo, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan|Seongnam-si, Gyeonggido, 463-707, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 05505, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 120-752, Korea, Republic of|Gdansk, 80-952, Poland|Szczecin-Zdunowo, 70-891, Poland|Warszawa, 02-781, Poland"

NCT00958022,Carboplatin and Etoposide Plus LBH589 for Small Cell Lung Cancer,TERMINATED,"The subjects are being asked to take part in the Phase I or Phase II portion of a research study of a new investigational drug, LBH589, in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, carboplatin with etoposide. LBH589 (made by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.) is considered ""investigational"" because it has not been approved for commercial use in the treatment of cancer by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Etoposide and carboplatin are chemotherapeutic agents approved by the FDA for the treatment of for small cell lung cancer.

LBH589 is a drug that may slow down the growth of cancer cells or kill cancer cells by blocking certain enzymes (proteins produced by cells). LBH589 has shown effects against cancer in laboratory studies and in studies using animals; however, it is not known if this medicine will show the same activity in humans. As of May 2006, approximately 100 patients have received treatment with either an intravenous or capsule form of LBH589. Only the capsule form of LBH589 will be used in this study.

The main goal during the Phase I portion of this research study is to find out the highest and safest dose of LBH589 that can be given in combination with carboplatin with etoposide in subjects with lung cancer without causing severe side effects. The main goal of the Phase II portion of this study is to find how the subject's lung cancer responds to the LBH589 in combination with carboplatin and etoposide at the highest and safest dose that was given in Phase I.

The subject may be enrolled in either Phase I or Phase II of the trial, depending on when they entered the study, but they will not be enrolled in both phases.

This study will also investigate how the subject's body processes the combination of LBH589 and carboplatin with etoposide. To determine this, the investigators will measure the amount of study drug in the subject's blood. This will be done with a series of blood tests, called pharmacokinetic (PK) tests. Pharmacokinetics is the study of how the study drug moves through the body. Other purposes of this study will be to sample the subject's genetic material (DNA/RNA) as well as to determine biomarkers in their blood. (For some cancers, biomarkers are a way to measure the extent of their disease or the effects of treatment.) These samples will also be stored for future studies.",NO,Small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: LBH589 and carboplatin with etoposide,"Evaluation of Target Lesions, 18 weeks","Evaluation of Best Overall Response, 18 weeks",,Ahmad Tarhini,Novartis Pharmaceuticals,PHASE1,7,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2009-09,2011-06,2011-06,2009-08-13,,2017-06-22,"University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States"

NCT06462105,Liposomal Irinotecan Combination Regimen for First-line Treatment of Small Cell Lung Cancer,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Lung cancer is a malignant tumor with high incidence and mortality in China and the world, among which small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 13% to 17% of lung cancer, and about 250,000 patients are diagnosed with SCLC every year in the world, and nearly 200,000 people die from it. Due to the high degree of malignancy of SCLC, it is easy to develop distant metastasis in the early stage, and most of the patients are diagnosed in the late stage with poor prognosis. Although SCLC is sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and has a high remission rate after initial treatment, it is prone to secondary drug resistance and relapse. SCLC is a low-differentiated, high-grade neuroendocrine tumor that can be classified into limited-stage and extensive stage (ES-SCLC). Etoposide combined with cisplatin (EP regimen) or carboplatin (EC regimen), irinotecan combined with cisplatin (IP regimen) or carboplatin (IC regimen) are the basis of standard first-line therapy for ES-SCLC. Immunocombined chemotherapy has also become the first-line standard treatment for ES-SCLC, among which serplulimab + etoposide + carboplatin is recommended by CSCO guidelines for first-line treatment. Liposomal irinotecan is irinotecan encapsulated by liposomes, which has advantages in safety. The study is expected to achieve good efficacy, improve the quality of life and prolong the survival of patients by combining the immune drug serplulimab on the basis of IC regimen. After replacing ordinary irinotecan with liposomal irinotecan, this study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of liposomal irinotecan + carboplatin + serplulimab with the first-line standard regimen (etoposide + carboplatin + serplulimab) in patients with extensive stage small-cell lung cancer, providing a better basis for clinical use.",NO,Small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Irinotecan Hydrochloride Liposome Injection；Carboplatin Injection；Serplulimab Injection,"Progression-free survival（PFS）, The PFS will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and 95% bilateral confidence intervals will be calculated, The time between the subject's signing of the informed consent and the onset of tumor progression (according to RECIST v1.1 criteria) or death.","Objective response rate（ORR）, ORR use cases, percentage representation, Percentage of tumor volume reduction to complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) (according to RECIST v1.1 criteria).|Disease control rate（DCR）, DCR use cases, percentage representation, Best tumor response based on RECIST1.1 criteria, the proportion of CR, PR and SD.|Overall survival（OS）, The OS will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and 95% bilateral confidence intervals will be calculated, The time between the subject signing the informed consent form and the patient's death due to various causes.|Incidence and severity of hematological and non-hematological adverse events, Safety: The number and frequency of adverse events, serious adverse events, and treatment-related adverse events (NCI CTCAE v5.0) individually and collectively were listed and the incidence rate was calculated., The time between the subject signing the informed consent and the end of treatment",,Zhou Chengzhi,Sun Yat-sen University|Hunan Cancer Hospital|Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine|First People's Hospital of Foshan|Youjiang Medical College for Nationalities,NA,60,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2024-07-05,2027-06-30,2027-06-30,2024-06-17,,2024-06-28,

NCT00004137,S9914: Combination Chemotherapy Plus Filgrastim in Untreated Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

Gocatamig is a new type of immunotherapy that uses a person's immune system to find and destroy cancer cells. Ifinatamab deruxtecan (also known as I-DXd) is a drug which binds to a specific target on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells. Durvalumab is a different type of immunotherapy that also destroys cancer cells. Researchers want to know if giving gocatamig, I-DXd, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab can treat SCLC that did not respond or stopped responding to a prior treatment.

The goals of this study are to learn:

* If gocatamig alone, I-DXd alone, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab are safe and well tolerated
* If people who receive gocatamig alone, I-DXd alone, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab have their SCLC get smaller or go away",NO,Small Cell Lung Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: Gocatamig|BIOLOGICAL: Ifinatamab Deruxtecan (I-DXd)|BIOLOGICAL: Durvalumab,"Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.

NCT03166254,Personalized Therapeutic Anti-tumor Vaccine With Pembrolizumab and Standard of Care Chemotherapy in Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer,WITHDRAWN,"Both metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are incurable with current therapies, but due to mutations induced by cigarette smoke, typically express a large number of altered proteins that can be recognized as foreign by the immune system. This antigenicity is thought to explain the efficacy of pembrolizumab as either a first or second line treatment in this disease. For patients who receive chemotherapy plus immunotherapy as a first line therapy, there is sound rationale for combination treatment with immunotherapy and a therapeutic antitumor vaccine as a maintenance strategy. Regardless of PD-L1 expression in the tumor, monoclonal antibodies that block PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are effective second line therapies after chemotherapy in both NSCLC and SCLC. In addition, by targeting the immune system against tumor specific antigens using a peptide vaccine, the efficacy of pembrolizumab alone is expected to be enhanced, with an improved response rate and prolonged overall survival with no additional toxicity.

If a participant did not have an event of disease progression and had not died on or prior to the cutoff for PFS analysis, the participant's data was censored at the date of their last disease assessment or randomization date provided participant did not have any post-baseline disease assessment.

Disease assessments were performed using computed tomography according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1.

Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the size of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm taking as reference the smallest lesion size recorded since the treatment started (baseline or after), or the appearance of one or more new lesions., From randomization up to the date the 126th PFS event was reached; Median time on follow-up was 7.3, 7.1, and 8.9 months in each treatment group respectively.","Phase 2: Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. If a participant did not die on or prior to the cut-off for OS analysis, the participant's data were censored at the date of their last known alive date, which is defined as the last date of the last survival follow-up visit, the start date of the last AE, the start date or end date of the last dose of any study drugs, the last lab and vital sign collection date, or the last disease assessment date, whichever occurred last., From randomization until the end of study; median time on follow-up was 10.0, 8.6, and 11.7 months in each treatment group respectively.|Phase 2: Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with objective response (confirmed) as assessed by the investigator using RECIST version 1.1. Objective response includes both complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Response must be confirmed at a subsequent tumor assessment at least 28 days apart. Participants with no post-baseline confirmed response were counted as non-responders.

CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm. No new lesions.

PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, and no new lesions., Tumor assessments were performed every 6 weeks for the first 30 weeks and every 9 weeks thereafter until disease progression; median time on follow-up was 7.3, 7.1, and 8.9 months in each group respectively.|Phase 1: Number of Participants With Adverse Events, The intensity of each adverse event (AE) was assessed utilizing the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0, and according to the following: Grade 1 (Mild): AE is transient and easily tolerated by the participant; Grade 2 (Moderate): AE causes the participant discomfort and interrupts the participant's usual activities; Grade 3/4 (Severe): The adverse event causes considerable interference with the participant's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening; Grade 5: Death.

Serious adverse events were those that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity., From first dose of any study drug to 30 days after the last dose; the median duration of treatment with veliparib across all groups in Phase 1 was 127.5 days.",,AbbVie,,PHASE1|PHASE2,221,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2014-10-13,2019-04-17,2019-04-17,2014-11-13,2020-05-14,2020-05-14,"Mayo Clinic - Scottsdale /ID# 129127, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259, United States|Univ of Colorado Cancer Center /ID# 129220, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Emory University Hospital /ID# 141682, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Georgia Regents University /ID# 148567, Augusta, Georgia, 30912, United States|Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine /ID# 137088, Chicago, Illinois, 60611-2927, United States|Herbert Herman Cancer Center /ID# 167020, Lansing, Michigan, 48912, United States|Gabrail Cancer Center Research /ID# 129216, Canton, Ohio, 44718, United States|Allegheny General Hospital /ID# 147328, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15212, United States|University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center /ID# 129213, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Southern Medical Day Care Ctr /ID# 155498, Wollongong, New South Wales, 2500, Australia|The Townsville Hospital /ID# 155499, Douglas, Queensland, 4814, Australia|Peninsula & South Eastern Haem /ID# 155497, Frankston, Victoria, 3199, Australia|Border Medical /ID# 157894, Wodonga, Victoria, 3690, Australia|Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc /ID# 151024, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, Bruxelles-Capitale, 1200, Belgium|CHU de Liege /ID# 151025, Liège, Liege, 4000, Belgium|UZ Antwerp /ID# 151026, Edegem, 2650, Belgium|C.H.U.de Mons Borinage /ID# 151023, Mons, 7000, Belgium|CHU UCL Namur /ID# 151022, Namur, 5000, Belgium|University of Calgary /ID# 152544, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4Z6, Canada|Cross Cancer Institute /ID# 132883, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|Juravinski Cancer Clinic /ID# 152543, Hamilton, Ontario, L8V 1C3, Canada|Hopital du Sacre Coeur Montreal /ID# 154436, Montreal, Quebec, H4J 1C5, Canada|Nemocnice Na Plesi s.r.o. /ID# 149825, Nová Ves pod Pleší, Pribram, 262 04, Czechia|Nemocnice Novy Jicin /ID# 149838, Nový Jičín 1, 741 01, Czechia|Vitkovicka nemocnice a. s. /ID# 149839, Ostrava, 703 84, Czechia|Multiscan s.r.o. /ID# 150887, Pardubice, 530-03, Czechia|CHU Dupuytren /ID# 153622, Limoges CEDEX 1, Franche-Comte, 87042, France|Centre Hospitalier Le Mans /ID# 158103, Le Mans CEDEX 9, Sarthe, 72037, France|Centre Hosp Intercommunal de Creteil /ID# 157970, Creteil, Val-de-Marne, 94000, France|Orszagos Koranyi Pulmonologiai Intezet /ID# 151351, Budapest XII, Budapest, 1122, Hungary|Markusovszky Egyetemi Oktatókórház /ID# 158806, Szombathely, Vas, 9700, Hungary|Debreceni Egyetem Klinikai Központ /ID# 151354, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary|Veszprem Megyei Tudogyogyintez /ID# 158807, Farkasgyepu, 8582, Hungary|Petz Aladar Megyei Oktato Korh /ID# 155352, Gyor, 9023, Hungary|Matrahaza Gyogyintezet /ID# 151355, Kékesteto, 3233, Hungary|Fejer Megyei Szent Gyorgy Korh /ID# 151352, Szekesfehervar, 8000, Hungary|Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok Megyei /ID# 155090, Szolnok, 5004, Hungary|Dong-A University Hospital /ID# 153187, Busan, Busan Gwang Yeogsi, 49201, Korea, Republic of|Chungbuk National Univ Hosp /ID# 153186, Cheongju, 361-240, Korea, Republic of|Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital /ID# 153188, Jeonnam, 58128, Korea, Republic of|Asan Medical Center /ID# 153185, Seoul, 05505, Korea, Republic of|Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen /ID# 131252, Groningen, 9713 GZ, Netherlands|Ziekenhuis St. Jansdal /ID# 151974, Harderwijk, 3844 DG, Netherlands|Atrium-Orbis Zuyderland Medisch Centrum /ID# 149830, Heerlen, 6419 PC, Netherlands|Erasmus Medisch Centrum /ID# 131251, Rotterdam, 3015 CE, Netherlands|Isala /ID# 151975, Zwolle, 8025 AB, Netherlands|S.C.

NCT00452634,Irinotecan/Cisplatin Plus Simvastatin in Extensive Disease-Small Cell Lung Cancer (ED-SCLC),COMPLETED,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly referred to as the statins, have proven therapeutic and preventative effects in cardiovascular diseases. Recently, there are emerging interests in their use as anticancer agents based on preclinical evidence of their antiproliferative, proapoptotic, anti-invasive, and radiosensitizing properties. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase by the statins interferes with the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway, leading to reduced levels of mevalonate and its downstream products, many of which play important roles in critical cellular functions such as membrane integrity, cell signaling, protein synthesis, and cell cycle progression. Perturbations of these processes in neoplastic cells by the statins may therefore result in control of tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. The statins have demonstrated growth inhibitory activity in cancer cell lines and preclinical tumor models in animals. Simvastatin, a member of the statin family, profoundly impaired basal and growth factor-stimulated SCLC cell growth in vitro and induced apoptosis. SCLC cells treated with simvastatin were sensitized to the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide. Moreover, SCLC tumour growth in vivo was inhibited by simvastatin.

NCT06853678,Second-line Immunotherapy for ES-SCLC,RECRUITING,"At present, the first-line standard treatment for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) is immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. For patients who relapse within 6 months after first-line chemotherapy, conventionally recommended chemotherapy drugs include topotecan, irinotecan, gemcitabine, paclitaxel or vinorelbine, etc., but due to limited benefits to patients, patients are also recommended to participate in relevant clinical studies. New treatment methods are constantly being explored in second-line treatment, including fluzoparib combined with adebelimumab. The current status of second-line treatment is still worrying.

Selinexor is a class of nuclear export selective inhibitors (SINEs) for the export protein receptor XPO1. PO1 promotes the transport of mRNA and cargo proteins, including tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs), hormone receptors (GRs), and immune response regulators. Selinexor covalently binds to the XPO1 protein, blocking the export of TSPs and GRs and accumulating them in the nucleus, preventing the translation of oncoprotein mRNA, stopping the cell cycle process, and initiating apoptosis. Multiple in vitro and in vivo studies have verified that selinexor combined with chemotherapy/radiotherapy/targeted therapy exhibits significant anti-tumor activity.

NCT04221529,Patients With ES-SCLC and ECOG PS=2 Receiving Atezolizumab-Carboplatin-Etoposide,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly proliferating, neuroendocrine tumor that accounts for about 15% of all lung cancers. Most patients have metastases at primary diagnosis involving sites like bone, adrenal glands, liver and brain.

Compared with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) SCLC has a unique natural history with a shorter doubling time, higher growth fraction, earlier development of widespread metastases, and uniform initial response to chemo- or radiotherapy.

The combination of cis- or carboplatin and etoposide is the standard of care in the first-line treatment of stage IV (extensive-disease) SCLC (ED-SCLC). Despite response rates of 50-80%, most patients relapse within six months and the median survival time is less than 10 months. Between 14 and 23% of SCLC patients develop brain metastases.

New cytotoxic agents as well as targeted therapies have not been able to show any improvement of survival in this group of patients.

Early phase trials of PD 1/PD L1-blocking immunotherapeutic agents in patients with recurrent or ED SCLC have shown promising response rates and good tolerability. Immunotherapy may also contribute to the efficacy of systemic treatment by maintaining initial responses to chemotherapy. A double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial indicates that the addition of atezolizumab to standard chemotherapy significantly improves overall survival and progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone in treatment-naïve patients with ED-SCLC who are in good general condition (ECOG 0 or 1). However, about one in three SCLC patients has a poor performance status (ECOG≥2), which is associated with even shorter survival times of under eight months. At present, there is little information regarding the feasibility, safety and efficacy of adding atezolizumab to standard chemotherapy for this considerable fraction of patients.

The investigators expect, that atezolizumab in addition to chemotherapy is feasible in patients with stage IV SCLC and reduced performance status and therefore crucial efficacy data can be acquired in this trial to evaluate a putative Phase III transition in this particular patient population.",NO,"SCLC, Extensive Stage",DRUG: Atezolizumab,"Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the length of time from first dose of experimental IMP (or first dose of chemotherapy, whichever occurs first) to the date of death.

Ongoing research has advanced the understanding of molecular categories and the immunologic microenvironment of SCLC, which in turn has helped improve disease classification and staging. Considering the role of molecular alterations has not yet fully to be defined in the treatment of SCLC, there is an urgent recognition that molecular alterations in the SCLC are important to predict response and survival for novel therapies and ongoing clinical trials. Advances in research have revealed critical information regarding biologic characteristics of the disease, which may lead to the identification of vulnerabilities and the development of new therapies. Further research focused on identifying biomarkers and evaluating innovative therapies will be paramount to improving treatment outcomes for patients with SCLC.

An adverse event could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, was also an adverse event. The number of participants who discontinued due to an AE was reported for each arm according to the treatment received and is presented for the first course of study treatment per protocol., Up to approximately 26 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Any Grade 3 to 5 Adverse Events (AE) as Assessed by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (CTCAE 4.03), The CTCAE uses Grades 1 through 5 correlating to AE severity criteria. Grade 1=mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2=moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Grade 3=severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL. Grade 4=life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5=death related to AE. The number of participants who experienced any Grade 3 to 5 AE was reported for each arm according to the treatment received and is presented for the first course of study treatment per protocol., Up to approximately 30.5 months|Change From Baseline at Week 18 in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scale, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire that rates the overall quality of life in cancer participants. The first 28 questions use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) for evaluating function (physical, role, social, cognitive, emotional), symptoms (diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and pain) and financial difficulties. The last 2 questions use a 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent) to evaluate overall health and quality of life. Scores are transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using a standard EORTC algorithm. Change from baseline scores were calculated using a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model. Negative change from baseline values indicated deterioration in health status or functioning and positive changes indicated improvement.

The QLQ-LC13 consists of 13 measures of lung cancer symptoms and side effects from chemotherapy and radiation. It is scored on a 4-point scale (1=none, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). Scores were transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using a standard algorithm. Higher scores represented increasing symptom severity. TTD was calculated using the product-limit Kaplan-Meier method for censored data and is presented for the first course of study treatment per protocol., Day 1 of Cycles 1-9, Day 1 of every other cycle for Cycles 10-17 and 30 days after last dose of study treatment (Up to approximately 27 months)",,Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC,,PHASE3,453,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2017-05-02,2019-12-02,2021-09-21,2017-02-28,2020-12-22,2022-10-03,"Baptist Health Medical Group Oncology, LLC ( Site 8000), Miami, Florida, 33176, United States|Rush University Medical Center ( Site 1215), Chicago, Illinois, 60612, United States|North Shore University Health System ( Site 1216), Evanston, Illinois, 60201, United States|Community Hospital ( Site 1207), Munster, Indiana, 46321, United States|Weinberg Cancer Institute at Franklin Square ( Site 1210), Baltimore, Maryland, 21237, United States|Massachusetts General Hospital ( Site 1203), Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( Site 1206), Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute [Boston] ( Site 1201), Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|University of Michigan ( Site 1217), Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109-5936, United States|Henry Ford Health System ( Site 1221), Detroit, Michigan, 48202, United States|Minnesota Oncology Hematology, PA ( Site 8001), Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55404, United States|Hattiesburg Clinic ( Site 1205), Hattiesburg, Mississippi, 39401, United States|Mercy Hospital Saint Louis ( Site 1213), Saint Louis, Missouri, 63141, United States|Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada ( Site 8004), Henderson, Nevada, 89074, United States|Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center At Basking Ridge ( Site 1226), Basking Ridge, New Jersey, 07920, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center- Monmouth ( Site 1225), Middletown, New Jersey, 07748, United States|Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care - Main site ( Site 1204), Bronx, New York, 10461, United States|Montefiore Medical Center ( Site 1222), Bronx, New York, 10467, United States|Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center at Commack ( Site 1227), Commack, New York, 11725, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center ( Site 1229), Harrison, New York, 10604, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center ( Site 1211), New York, New York, 10065, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center - Rockville Centre ( Site 1228), Rockville Centre, New York, 11570, United States|Duke University Medical Center ( Site 1214), Durham, North Carolina, 27710, United States|Bon Secours St. Francis Health Sytem ( Site 1212), Greenville, South Carolina, 29607, United States|Tennessee Oncology, PLLC/The Sarah Cannon Research Institute ( Site 1230), Nashville, Tennessee, 37203, United States|Texas Oncology ( Site 8002), Austin, Texas, 78745, United States|Texas Oncology-Baylor Charles A.

PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

Cancer patients may develop side effects during treatment, such as nausea, pain, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, or shortness of breath. These symptoms may be due to the cancer itself, or due to treatments.

If patients do not feel well, the investigators may need to change the way they are treating the patients or prescribe therapies that will decrease their symptoms.

NCT06717243,Genomic and Methylation Markers in SCLC and LCNEC for Chemo-Immunotherapy Resistance Prediction (STRATUS),RECRUITING,"The goal of this observational study is to understand how genomic and epigenetic factors contribute to resistance against chemo-immunotherapy in adults diagnosed with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) or metastatic large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). Both ES-SCLC and LCNEC are aggressive forms of lung cancer with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. While initial responses to chemo-immunotherapy are often promising, most patients develop resistance within a few months, resulting in disease progression and limited survival. This study seeks to explore the molecular and cellular changes that drive resistance, providing insights that could guide more personalized and effective treatment strategies in the future.

The study focuses on identifying genomic and methylation signatures, as well as analyzing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and tumor DNA (ctDNA), to better understand the mechanisms of resistance. By collecting and analyzing these biomarkers over time, researchers aim to identify patterns that distinguish patients who benefit long-term from therapy from those who experience early resistance. These findings may pave the way for new diagnostic tools and therapies to predict and overcome resistance to chemo-immunotherapy.

The main questions this study seeks to answer are:

Are there specific genomic or methylation patterns that predict resistance to chemo-immunotherapy in ES-SCLC and LCNEC? How are circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and tumor DNA (ctDNA) associated with disease progression, treatment response, and survival? What molecular differences exist between patients who respond long-term and those who develop resistance early in their treatment?

Participants will:

Provide blood and tumor tissue samples before treatment to establish baseline molecular profiles.

Undergo follow-up visits every 9 weeks during treatment, where additional blood samples and imaging tests will be collected to monitor disease progression and treatment response.

Optionally provide tissue samples through re-biopsy if the disease progresses, enabling researchers to compare changes in tumor biology over time.

All blood and tissue samples will be de-identified and securely stored for genomic and epigenetic analyses. Blood samples will be examined for circulating tumor cells and tumor DNA, while tumor tissue samples will undergo in-depth genomic and methylation profiling. Researchers will use advanced molecular and bioinformatics techniques to uncover specific patterns associated with resistance, aiming to improve current treatment strategies and develop more precise therapies.

The study will analyze data from patients over three years, encompassing various stages of treatment and disease progression. By examining longitudinal samples, the study aims to capture the dynamic changes that occur in the tumor microenvironment and how these relate to treatment outcomes.

This research is particularly important because current treatment options for ES-SCLC and LCNEC are limited, and there are no established methods to predict which patients will respond to chemo-immunotherapy. Identifying biomarkers of resistance could transform clinical care, allowing oncologists to tailor treatments to individual patients' molecular profiles and improve survival outcomes.

Ultimately, the findings from this study could lead to the development of new biomarkers for resistance, improve early detection of treatment failure, and provide the foundation for novel therapies targeting resistant cancer cells.

Estimating the change point identifies the point in time that patients' functional status scores change during the 12-months post-diagnosis., At 12 months|Factors Associated With Resiliency, Evaluated using GLMMS. Resiliency will be defined as the ability to maintain or regain at least 50% of baseline functional status at any point during the 12 months after diagnosis with specific emphasis at 3 and 6-months post- the start of treatment. The association between resiliency and clinical factors will be evaluated with appropriate statistical techniques for the specific measure (e.g. Chi-square tests will compare categorical variables between participants demonstrating resiliency vs. worsening functional status; a two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon Rank Sum test will compare continuous variables)., Up to 12 months",,Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center,National Institute on Aging (NIA),NA,18,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE,2020-01-22,2021-06-22,2022-06-22,2020-01-18,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, United States"
